What is nc-cms?
===============

Super lightweight and simple PHP Content Management System (CMS) designed with the primary goals of being user friendly and quick to integrate, while retaining the most important features of a modern day CMS. 

Open source and free to use project licensed under the zlib/libpng license. nc-cms was written in PHP and will run on any web server that supports PHP 5 or higher.

Can optionally use a database for content storage (MySQL, etc.). However, a database is not required, and nc-cms uses a super fast flat file system by default.

Some kind words from the community...

"I can't begin to describe to you what a life saver it is not having to rebuild an entire site on a CMS platform."

"Overall, a very quick way to start up a stable, dynamic site with minimal overhead!"

"Thanks for such a killer cms that is so simple.. great concept!"
